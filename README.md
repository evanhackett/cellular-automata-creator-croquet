# Collaborative Cellular Automata Creator

Users can enter a function which will define the rules of a cellular automata.
Looping through the grid, coloring cells, and getting neighboring cells are abstracted away.

Multiple users can view/edit the same simulation at the same time. This is made possible (and easy!) via the [Croquet](https://croquet.io/) library.

If you want to share your session with someone else, you must send them the complete url which includes the session id.
